ðŸ”¹ 3. How to Review a Clause
Open the Clause Selector Panel

Choose a clause ID (e.g. telemetry-042)

View the avatar animation and HUD alerts

Review the fidelity report for pose, animation, and confidence scoring

Check the recovery dashboard for retry status and resilience score

ðŸ”¹ 4. Evidence Artifacts
hud-frame.json: Pose and animation data

clause-fidelity-report.json: Deviation and recovery scoring

simulation-health-report.json: Cross-persona fidelity summary

clause-manifest.yaml: Viewer and evidence linkage

ðŸ”¹ 5. Governance Notes
All deviations are logged and annotated in Grafana

Retry pipelines are automated via Tekton

Reports are exportable for audit and compliance
